# CIBL
This repository corresponds to the jupyter scripts of the CIBL-utterance classification project done with the CIAE. The description of each script follows:
 
1. Data Analyse Text Books: statistical analysis of the previous model source for training LDA models (physics textbooks)
2. Data Analyse Utterances: statistical analysis of the documents with the utterances conforming the data base.
3. Word Embedding Models: implementation of the first word embedding models with NN for utterance classification.
4. Attention Models: implementation of the attention models for utterance classification.
5. Model Evaluation: sequential evaluation of the different models and accuracy analysis and vizualizations.
6. Entropy Analysis: entropy analysis of the attention/final classification outputs.
7. Inter-Rater Analysis: analysis of model performance with data labeled by two different human coders.
